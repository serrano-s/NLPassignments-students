This is essentially converting the input prompt into a sequence of tokens. Note that the tokenizer returns a dictionary with the tokenized input ids and attention mask. The `input_ids` are the token ids that the model will use as input. `\"attention_mask`\" is a mask vector that indicates if a particular token corresponds to padding. Padding is extremely important when we are dealing with variable length sequences. Through padding, we can ensure that all the sequences in a batch are of the same size. When feeding sequences with padding to a transformer based model, we need to make sure that the model doesn't attend to the padding tokens. The `attention_mask` is used the tokens that are to be ignored in the attention operation. Note that here since we only used a single input sequence, there was no need of padding and that's why all the attention mask values are 1, i.e. none of the tokens in the sequences should be ignored by attention blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 2:** The `generate()` function takes the tokenized input and generates a sequence of tokens as output. The function takes in a number of arguments, the most important of which are `max_new_tokens` and `do_sample`. The `max_new_tokens` argument specifies the maximum number of new tokens to be generated. The `do_sample` argument is used to turn on sampling, if false, greedy decoding is used. If `do_sample` is set to `True`, then the `top_p` and `temperature` arguments are used to control the sampling process. The `top_p` argument is the value of $p$ parameter for top-p or nucleus sampling and the `temperature` argument is used to control the temperature sampling. Notice that the `generate()` function returns as output a sequence of token ids.\n",

        "Our student model is a language model and inherently a language model's job is to predict continuations of a sequence by predicting one token at a time. To perform specific tasks like summarization using language models, we need to prepare the data in such a format such that the possible continuation of the sequence is the output we want i.e. in this case the summary of the article.\n",

        "Useful tips:\n",
        "- While tokenizing the articles, by calling `tokenizer()` make sure to set `padding=\"max_length\"` and `truncation=True` so that the articles are padded to the same length and truncated if they are longer than the maximum length. Also, make sure to set `return_tensors=\"pt\"` so that the output is a PyTorch tensor and `max_length` to the maximum length of the articles."
