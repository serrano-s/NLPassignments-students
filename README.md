# NLPassignments-students
Student releases of assignments for UW CSE 447 and 517.

**If you have access to it, the private repo for course staff to access assignment solutions/autograder setups can be found [here](https://github.com/serrano-s/NLPassignments-coursestaff/tree/main).**

NOTE: In order for `data-needed.txt` files to work correctly with the bash script at the top of the homework jupyter notebooks, there HAS to be a newline after the last listed data file; otherwise, the last one won't be downloaded.
